::: {.callout-important}
The coding phase is officially finished! I’m now working on turning the insights and results from this repo into a full-length article. In the meantime, feel free to check out the source code and documentation right [here](https://github.com/daffadaniel/02-RFMAnalysis).

<!-- ## Objective
Transform raw transaction data into actionable customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns.

## Methodology
- Calculated **Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM)** scores  
- Applied log transformation + standardization to handle skewness  
- Determined optimal number of clusters using **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**  
- Trained K-Means and interpreted resulting segments

## Results
- Optimal number of clusters: **6**  
- Clear, business-friendly segment profiles identified

## Customer Segments

| Segment          | % of Customers | Key Traits                          | Recommended Action             |

| At-Risk          | 15 %           | High past spend, long time inactive | Win-back campaign              |
| Hibernating      | 30 %           | Low frequency & monetary            | Re-engagement offers           |
| New Customers    | 12 %           | Very recent, low frequency          | Onboarding, education          |
| Lost             | 13 %           | Very long inactive, low spend       | Minimal effort or ignore       |
